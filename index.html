<h2>S.M.A.R.T. Goal #2</h2>
<p>To improve our customer service levels by reducing our response time to all our client's request by 15% by the end of year 2021.</p>
<h4>Customer Benefits</h4>
<p>We are looking to increase customer productivity by quickly addressing their needs.</p>
<h4>Processes</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Financial Resources:</b> Assign 30% of our operational budget to higher 5 new customer service representatives, train them and onboard them.</li>
	<li><b>Physical Environment:</b> To provide our customer service team members with ergonomic equipment including: better headsets, ergonomic mouse</br>
	and keyboard, bigger monitors, adjustable desk (that will allow them to work standing or sitting).</li>
	<li><b>Infrastructure:</b> We will enhance our process with a new ticketing system that will allow our customer service team to log in tickets faster,</br>
	 the new ticketing system will have our clients contact and technology pre-loaded.</li>
	<li><b>Incoming Contact Distribution System:</b> Introduce the usage of Microsoft Teams, this will allow our team members to quickly interact with</br>
	each other and escalate to management, via chat, video conference or voice over IP phone; getting faster response time.</li>
	<li><b>Remote Support Tools:</b> We will install remote desk software to allow our customer service representative to log in to the customers'</br>
	computer remotely and assess & diagnost the problem faster.</li>
	<li><b>Knowledge Management:</b> Our new ticketing system comes with a knowledge management module. This knowledge management module will allow our</br>
	customer service team similar incidents this customer has reported before (access to history of incidents). This module also provides answers to</br>
	Frequently Asked Questions.</li>
	<li><b>Reporting Tools:</b> Our customer service team will have the ability to run multiple reports about the customer that he/she is servicing as</br>
	well as all the software and hardware the customer uses.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Measurements</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Average time to respond:</b> We will measure and evaluate periodically key events: customer calls, customer service answers, issue is logged,</br>
	and ticket is created, issue is resolved, and ticket is closed.</li>
	<li><b>Customer feedback:</b> We will deploy a new system of customer surveys to capture customer feedback. We will associate feedback with customer,</br>
	incident, and customer service representative, and evaluate accordingly.</li>
	<li><b>Periodic Customer Satisfaction Management:</b> Our management will meet with every one of our clients every 3 months for a quarterly review to</br>
	assess customer satisfaction and capture feedback.</li>
</ul>
